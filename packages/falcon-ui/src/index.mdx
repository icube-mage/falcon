# Get Started [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40deity%2Ffalcon-ui.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40deity%2Ffalcon-ui)

[**@deity/falcon-ui**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deity/falcon-ui) is a library of composable, themable, design-system-driven UI components for React.


## Features

- over **30 UI components** that are great basis for any component based design system

- super small - **~17KB** gzipped, ~55KB minified - including all dependencies ([emotion 10](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion))

- **tree shaking friendly** - it really works even with [webpack code splitting](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7782)

- build-in [**design constraints theme**](/theming) that improves maintability and consistency of UI immensely

- phenomenal UI authoring experience: **[responsive, theme-based style props] (/responsive-props)**, no selector hell, proper style scoping, performant dynamic styling (object styles notation)

- great **TypeScript support** - type definitions, source maps, code completion for [responsive, them-based style props] (/responsive-props)

- [**single element pattern**](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/introducing-the-single-element-pattern-dfbd2c295c5d) best practices accordance making components as consistent as native HTML elements

- **automatic & transparent critical styles**, **code splitting**  and **server side rendering** support (thanks to [emotion 10](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion)) 

## Installation

```bash
  yarn add @deity/falcon-ui
  # or npm i @deity/falcon-ui
```

## Usage

Wrap the root of your application with the `ThemeProvider` component,
which adds the design constraints theme to the context for use in **@deity/falcon-ui** components.
ThemeProvider component accepts a `theme` prop for setting a [custom theme](/theming).


```javascript
import { ThemeProvider, Button } from '@deity/falcon-ui';

const App = (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button p="md" bg="secondary">Hello!</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```
