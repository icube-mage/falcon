# Responsive theme-based props

## Introduction

All **`@deity/falcon-ui`** components accept responsive, theme-based style props which offer easy to use, flexible yet consistent styling customization.

Responsive, theme-based style props can be used inline on component:

```javascript
  <Button px="lg" bg="primaryLight">Hello</Button>
```

or defined in theme:



```javascript
const theme = createTheme({
  components: {
    button: {
      px: 'lg',
      bg: 'primaryLight'
    }
  }
});
```
All of `@deity/falcon-ui` components come with default theme which can be overridden as shown in the example above.

<Playground>
  <Box my="lg">
      Responsive theme-based style props playground
  </Box>

  <GridLayout gridGap="lg" gridTemplateColumns="1fr 1fr">
      <Box p="md" bg="primary" color="primaryText" mt="md">Item1</Box>
      <Box p="md" bg="primaryDark" fontSize="xxl">Item2</Box>
      <Box p="md" bg="secondary" boxShadow="subtle">Item3</Box>
      <Box p="md" bg="secondaryLight" borderRadius="round">Item4</Box>
  </GridLayout>
</Playground>


## Responsive notation
All of the responsive theme-based props work seamlessy with `breakpoints` defined in `Theme`.

<ViewThemeSection section="breakpoints">
  view available theme breakpoints
</ViewThemeSection>

Simply pass object as responsive prop value with its keys being breakpoints keys defined in `Theme` and values being property values to have responsive prop that changes based on 
screen width. 

Breakpoint values defined in Theme get replaced with `@media screen and (min-width :...)` media query.

<Playground>
  <Button px={{ xs: 'sm', md: 'xxl' }}> Hello!</Button>
  <Box bg={{ sm: 'primary', lg: 'secondaryLight' }} p="lg" mt="md">
    Responsive props!
  </Box>
</Playground>


## Css prop
All `@deity/falcon-ui` components include `css` prop as an escape hatch for more complex and one-off styles.
`Css` prop accepts CSS properties as an object literal or function with props param that has theme and returns CSS properties as an object literal.

<Playground>
  <Button css={{ transform: 'skew(25deg)' }}>
    <Box css={({ theme }) => ({
            color: theme.colors.secondaryLight,
            transform: 'skew(-25deg)'
    })}>
      Css prop in Action!
    </Box>
  </Button>
</Playground>

<Divider my="xxl" borderColor="secondaryDark"/>
