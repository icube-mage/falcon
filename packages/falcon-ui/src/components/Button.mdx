<ThemePreview of={Button}/>

`Button` component by default renders as `<button>` and accepts all of the `button` props (`onClick` etc)
 as well as all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) that allow further styling customizations.

It ships with `secondary` variant by default.

<Playground>
  <Button>Hello!</Button>
  <Button ml="md" variant="secondary">
    Secondary
  </Button>
</Playground>

`Button` component can be rendered as any other component such as for example `<input type="submit">` 
or [react-router-dom]('https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy') `Link`.

<Playground>
  <Button as="input" type="submit" value="As an input" />
  <Button as="a" href='/responsive-props' ml="md">As a link</Button>
</Playground>
