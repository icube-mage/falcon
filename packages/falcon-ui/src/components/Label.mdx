<ThemePreview of={Label} />

`Label` component is rendered as an `<label>` and accepts all of the `<label>` props (`htmlFor`, `onClick` etc) 
as well as all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) that allow further styling customizations.

```javascript
import { Label } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

<Playground>
  <Label ml="xs" htmlFor="name">Name</Label>
  <Input id="name" type="text" />
</Playground>
