`Link` component is rendered as an `<a>` and accepts all of the `<a>` props (`href`, `onClick` etc) 
as well as all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) that allow further styling customizations.

```javascript
import { Link } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

`Link` can be easily integrated with `react-router`'s `Link` component in order to provide
styling for it.

<Playground>
  <Link as={ReactRouterLink} to="/responsive-props">As React router link</Link>
</Playground>
