`Avatar` component is rendered as an `<img>` element and accepts all of the `<img>` props, its size can be easily adjusted via theme-based `size`,
 but it also accepts other [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) that allow further styling customizations.

```javascript
import { Avatar } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```
