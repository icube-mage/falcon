<ThemePreview of={Badge} />

`Badge` component's size can be easily adjusted via `size`, `height` or `width` theme based props,
 but it also accepts all the other [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) that allow further styling customizations.

 ```javascript
import { Badge } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

<Playground>
  <Badge>9</Badge>
  <Badge ml="sm" size="xl" fontSize="md">
    12
  </Badge>
</Playground>
