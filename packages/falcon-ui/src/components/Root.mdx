<ThemePreview of={Root} />

`Root` component allows applying common styles across all components defined within, like default typography or `box-sizing`.
It's rendered as a first child of `ThemeProvider` component by default so all other components
inherit styles from it if those are not specified somewhere else down the hierarchy.
It accepts all of the [responsive, theme-based style props](/responsive-props) for further styling customizations.

```javascript
import { Root } from '@deity/falcon-ui';
```

<Playground>
  <Root>
    <Text>Hello!</Text>
  </Root>
</Playground>
