# Falcon Shop Extension

This extension provides basic features that allow for shop implementation. 

The main part of the extension is [GraphQL Schema](./src/schema.grapqhql) that defines data types, queries and mutations required by the shop. The extension doesn't depend on the backend platform but tries to provide a layer of abstraction on top of shop functionality.
