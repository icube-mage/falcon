# Babel preset Falcon Client

**You donâ€™t need to install it separately in** `@deity/falcon-client` **project.**

This preset uses the `useBuiltIns` option with [@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread.html), which assumes that `Object.assign` is available or polyfilled.
